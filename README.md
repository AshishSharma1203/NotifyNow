# NotifyNow
Being an MNNITIAN we all are having so busy day schedule that we often miss important notification . Usually we have to login to our academic portals and then check out the notifications . And most of us usually don't do this. We are creating a tool for our college academic's website which can detect the important notifications from there and send that particular info to the students on their whatsApp  ; which we regularly check .
